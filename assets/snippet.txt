● CrediFlow: AI Pipeline for Loan Approvals                                                                  Personal Project | 2025
• Challenge: Manual loan approvals lacked speed, transparency, and model reproducibility, especially with imbalanced
            datasets.
• Action:
    • Built an MLOps-ready ML pipeline for data validation, preprocessing, and SMOTEENN-based balancing.
    • Trained a TensorFlow ANN, achieving ~94% accuracy. Logged metrics and models using MLflow for versioning.
    • Deployed an app supporting real-time and batch predictions, with integrated LLM support for user-friendly insights.
• Result:
    • Achieved ~94% accuracy and F1-score with explainability via feature importance.
    • Enabled end-to-end scalable deployment with SQLite storage, MLflow registry, and single-command execution.
